## Introduction

Kenning aims towards providing modular execution blocks for:

* dataset management,
* model training,
* model optimization and compilation for a given target hardware,
* running models using efficient runtimes on target device,
* model evaluation and performance reports.

These can be used seamlessly regardless of underlying frameworks for the above-mentioned steps.

Kenning's aim is not to bring yet another training or compilation framework for deep learning models - there are lots of mature and versatile frameworks that support certain models, training routines, optimization techniques, hardware platforms and other components crucial to the deployment flow.
Still, there is no framework that would support all of the models or target hardware devices - especially the support matrix between compilation frameworks and target hardware is extremely sparse.
This means that any change in the application, especially in hardware, may end up in a necessity to change the entirety or a significant part of the application flow.

Kenning addresses this issue by providing a unified API that focuses on deployment tasks rather than their implementation - the developer decides which implementation should be used for each task, and with Kenning, it is possible to do in a seamless way.
This way, switching to another target platform results, in most cases, in a very small change in the code, instead of reimplementing larger parts of a project.
This is how Kenning can get the most out of the existing Deep Neural Network training and compilation frameworks.

Seamless nature of Kenning also allows developers to quickly evaluate the model on various stages of optimizations and compare them as shown in [Kenning usage](#kenning-usage).

## Kenning installation

### Module installation with pip

To install Kenning with its basic dependencies with `pip`, run:

```bash test-skip
pip install -U git+https://github.com/antmicro/kenning.git
```

Since Kenning can support various frameworks, and not all of them are required for users' particular use cases, some of the requirements are optional.
We can distinguish the following groups of extra requirements:

* `tensorflow` - modules for work with TensorFlow models (ONNX conversions, addons, and TensorFlow framework),
* `torch` - modules for work with PyTorch models,
* `mxnet` - modules for work with MXNet models,
* `nvidia_perf` - modules for performance measurements for NVIDIA GPUs,
* `object_detection` - modules for work with YOLOv3 object detection and the Open Images Dataset V6 computer vision dataset,
* `speech_to_text` - modules for work with audio samples and speech-to-text models,
* `iree` - modules for IREE compilation and runtime,
* `tvm` - modules for Apache TVM compilation and runtime,
* `onnxruntime` - modules for ONNX Runtime,
* `nni` - modules for Neural Network Intelligence optimizers,

To install the extra requirements, e.g. `tensorflow`, run:

```bash test-skip
sudo pip install git+https://github.com/antmicro/kenning.git#egg=kenning[tensorflow]
```

or, in newer `pip` releases:

```bash test-skip
pip install "kenning[tensorflow] @ git+https://github.com/antmicro/kenning.git"
```

### Working directly with the repository

For development purposes, and to use additional resources (such as sample scripts), clone the repository with:

```bash test-skip
git clone https://github.com/antmicro/kenning.git
cd kenning/
```

Then install using:

```bash
pip install -e ".[tensorflow,tflite,tvm,reports]"
```

`core` classes used throughout the entire Kenning framework:

* `Dataset` class - performs dataset download, preparation, dataset-specific input preprocessing (i.e. input file opening, normalization), output postprocessing and model evaluation,
* `ModelWrapper` class - trains the model, prepares the model, performs model-specific input preprocessing and output postprocessing, runs inference on host using native framework,
* `Optimizer` class - optimizes and compiles the model,
* `Runtime` class - loads the model, performs inference on compiled model, runs target-specific processing of inputs and outputs, and runs performance benchmarks,
* `Protocol` class - implements the communication protocol between the host and the target,
* `DataProvider` class - implements data provision from such sources as camera, TCP connection or others for inference,
* `OutputCollector` class - implements parsing and utilization of data from inference (such as displaying the visualizations, sending the results to via TCP),
* `Runner` class - represents single runtime processing block.

## Kenning usage

There are several ways to use Kenning:

* Using executable scripts from the `scenarios` submodule, configurable via JSON files (recommended approach);
* Using executable scripts from the `scenarios` submodule, configurable via command-line arguments;
* Using Kenning as a Python module.

Kenning scenarios are executable scripts that can be used for:

* Model training and benchmarking using its native framework ([`kenning.scenarios.model_training`](https://github.com/antmicro/kenning/blob/main/kenning/scenarios/model_training.py)),
* Model optimization and compilation for target hardware ([`kenning.scenarios.inference_tester`](https://github.com/antmicro/kenning/blob/main/kenning/scenarios/inference_tester.py)),
* Model benchmarking on target hardware ([`kenning.scenarios.inference_tester`](https://github.com/antmicro/kenning/blob/main/kenning/scenarios/inference_tester.py) and [`kenning.scenarios.inference_server`](https://github.com/antmicro/kenning/blob/main/kenning/scenarios/inference_server.py)),
* Rendering performance and quality reports from benchmark data ([`kenning.scenarios.render_report`](https://github.com/antmicro/kenning/blob/main/kenning/scenarios/render_report.py)),
* and more.

They are available through the `kenning` executable as subcommands.
To get the current list of subcommands, run:

```bash
kenning -h
```

The available subcommands are:

* `train` - trains the given model (`kenning.scenarios.model_training`).
* `optimize` - optimizes and compiles the model for a given target device (`kenning.scenarios.inference_tester`).
* `test` - runs benchmark and evaluation of the model on the target device (`kenning.scenarios.inference_tester`).

* `flow` - runs Kenning-based applications.
* `visual-editor` - runs a graphical interface letting you represent, edit and run optimizations and applications in-browser using [Pipeline Manager](https://github.com/antmicro/kenning-pipeline-manager).
* `fine-tune-optimizers` - runs a search for the best optimizations for a given target platform based on selected optimizers, runtimes and models, along with their settings.
* `server` - runs a benchmark and evaluation server on target device.
* `info` - provides information about a given Kenning class.
* `list` - lists available Kenning modules for optimization and runtime.
* `fuzzy-search` - searches for class path across Kenning and returns it.

### Running Kenning

Let's start off with installing the module and its necessary dependencies:

```bash test-skip
pip install "kenning[tensorflow,tflite,tvm,pipeline_manager,reports] @ git+https://github.com/antmicro/kenning.git"
```

Kenning provides two tools for displaying information about available classes: `kenning list` and `kenning info`.

The `kenning list` tool lists all available modules used to form optimization and runtime pipelines in Kenning.
Running:

For more verbose information, use the `-v` and `-vv` flags (module dependencies, description, supported formats and more)

The `kenning info` tool provides more detailed information on a given class, e.g. for:

```bash
kenning info kenning.optimizers.tflite.TFLiteCompiler
```

We should get something like:

```

```

If a certain class does not have necessary dependencies installed, Kenning suggests what modules need to be installed, e.g.:

```
This method requires additional dependencies, please use `pip install "kenning[tensorflow]"` to install them.
```

The classes described above are used to form optimization and evaluation scenarios in Kenning.
Some of them can also be used to quickly prototype simple applications.

With Kenning, we can combine multiple compilers and optimizers to create a fast and small model, including embedded devices.
The optimization flow can be defined in JSON format, as follows:

```json test-skip
{
  "model_wrapper": {
    "type": "kenning.modelwrappers.classification.tensorflow_pet_dataset.TensorFlowPetDatasetMobileNetV2",
    "parameters": {
      "model_name": "tvm-avx2-int8",
      "model_path": "kenning:///models/classification/tensorflow_pet_dataset_mobilenetv2.h5"
    }
  },
  "dataset": {
    "type": "kenning.datasets.pet_dataset.PetDataset",
    "parameters": {
      "dataset_root": "./build/PetDataset"
    }
  },
  "optimizers": [
    {
      "type": "kenning.optimizers.tflite.TFLiteCompiler",
      "parameters": {
        "target": "int8",
        "compiled_model_path": "./build/int8.tflite",
        "inference_input_type": "int8",
        "inference_output_type": "int8",
        "dataset_percentage": 0.01
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "kenning.optimizers.tvm.TVMCompiler",
      "parameters": {
        "target": "llvm -mcpu=core-avx2",
        "conv2d_data_layout": "NCHW",
        "compiled_model_path": "./build/int8_tvm.tar"
      }
    }
  ],
  "runtime": {
    "type": "kenning.runtimes.tvm.TVMRuntime",
    "parameters": {
      "save_model_path": "./build/int8_tvm.tar"
    }
  }
}
```

The above scenario takes the MobileNetV2 model trained for classification of cat and dog breeds, and passes it to:

* `kenning.optimizers.tflite.TFLiteCompiler` to quantize the weights of the model
* `kenning.optimizers.tvm.TVMCompiler` to create an optimized runtime of the model, utilizing AVX2 vector instructions.

The optimization of the model, its evaluation and report generation can be run with one command:

```bash test-skip
kenning optimize test report --json-cfg sample.json --measurements out.json --report-path report.md --to-html report-html
```

The generated report can be found in the `report-html` directory.

## Using Kenning as a library in Python scripts

Kenning is also a regular Python module - after pip installation it can be used in Python scripts.
The example compilation of the model can look as follows:

```python test-skip
from pathlib import Path
from kenning.datasets.pet_dataset import PetDataset
from kenning.modelwrappers.classification.tensorflow_pet_dataset import TensorFlowPetDatasetMobileNetV2
from kenning.optimizers.tflite import TFLiteCompiler
from kenning.runtimes.tflite import TFLiteRuntime
from kenning.core.measurements import MeasurementsCollector
from kenning.utils.resource_manager import ResourceURI

dataset = PetDataset(
    root=Path('./build/pet-dataset/')
)
model = TensorFlowPetDatasetMobileNetV2(
    model_path=ResourceURI('kenning:///models/classification/tensorflow_pet_dataset_mobilenetv2.h5'),
    dataset=dataset
)
model.save_io_specification(model.model_path)
compiler = TFLiteCompiler(
    dataset=dataset,
    compiled_model_path=Path('./build/compiled-model.tflite'),
    modelframework='keras',
    target='default',
    inferenceinputtype='float32',
    inferenceoutputtype='float32'
)
compiler.compile(
    input_model_path=ResourceURI('kenning:///models/classification/tensorflow_pet_dataset_mobilenetv2.h5')
)
```

The above script downloads the dataset and compiles the model with FP32 inputs and outputs using TensorFlow Lite.

To get a quantized model, replace `target`, `inferenceinputtype` and `inferenceoutputtype` to `int8`:

```python test-skip
compiler = TFLiteCompiler(
    dataset=dataset,
    compiled_model_path=Path('./build/compiled-model.tflite'),
    modelframework='keras',
    target='int8',
    inferenceinputtype='int8',
    inferenceoutputtype='int8',
    dataset_percentage=0.3
)
compiler.compile(
    input_model_path=ResourceURI('kenning:///models/classification/tensorflow_pet_dataset_mobilenetv2.h5')
)
```

To check how the compiled model is performing, create `TFLiteRuntime` object and run local model evaluation:

```python test-skip
runtime = TFLiteRuntime(
    protocol=None,
    model_path=Path('./build/compiled-model.tflite')
)

runtime.run_locally(
    dataset,
    model,
    Path('./build/compiled-model.tflite')
)
MeasurementsCollector.save_measurements('out.json')
```

The `runtime.run_locally` method runs benchmarks of the model on the current device.

The `MeasurementsCollector` class collects all benchmarks' data for model inference and saves it in JSON format that can be later used to render reports with the `kenning.scenarios.render_report` script.

As it can be observed, all classes accessible from JSON files in these scenarios share their configuration a with the classes in the Python scripts mentioned above.

## Adding new implementations

`Dataset`, `ModelWrapper`, `Optimizer`, `Protocol`, `Runtime` and other classes from the `kenning.core` module have dedicated directories for their implementations.
Each method in the base classes that requires implementation raises an `NotImplementedError` exception.
They can be easily implemented or extended, but they need to conform to certain rules, usually described in the source documentation.

For more details and examples on how the Kenning framework can be adjusted and enhanced, follow the [Kenning documentation](https://antmicro.github.io/kenning/).
Implemented methods can be also overridden, if necessary.

Most of the base classes implement `form_argparse` and `from_argparse` methods.
The former creates an argument parser and a group of arguments specific to the base class.
The latter creates an object of the class based on the arguments from argument parser.

Inheriting classes can modify `form_argparse` and `from_argparse` methods to provide better control over their processing, but they should always be based on the results of their base implementations.
