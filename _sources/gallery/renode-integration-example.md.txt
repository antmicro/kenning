# Bare-metal IREE runtime simulated using Renode

This tutorial shows how to compile models with [IREE](https://github.com/openxla/iree) and evaluate them using the [Kenning bare-metal IREE runtime](https://github.com/antmicro/kenning-bare-metal-iree-runtime) working in [Renode](https://renode.io).

The platform used for testing is a Springbok RISC-V AI accelerator with V Extension.
For more details, check:

* [Co-developing RISC-V AI solutions using Vector Extensions in Renode with Kenning bare-metal runtime and IREE](https://antmicro.com/blog/2023/05/kenning-bare-metal-iree-runtime-renode/) blog note
* [Kenning bare-metal IREE Runtime repository](https://github.com/antmicro/kenning-bare-metal-iree-runtime)

## Setup

For quick setup, use `docker` to open the environment with all necessary dependencies installed:

```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):$(pwd) -w $(pwd) -it ghcr.io/antmicro/kenning-bare-metal-iree-runtime:latest
```

Let's also create a `workspace` directory to store results of the simulation, as well as Kenning reports:

```bash
mkdir -p workspace && cd workspace
```
Alternatively, install them manually by following the instructions in the [runtime's README.md](https://github.com/antmicro/kenning-bare-metal-iree-runtime/blob/main/README.md):

Kenning uses [pyrenode3](https://github.com/antmicro/pyrenode3/) package, which requires Renode to work.
Here there is no need to install it, because it is already included in the `docker` image (path under the `PYRENODE_PKG` environmental variable).

For other Renode configuration options check [pyrenode3 README.md](https://github.com/antmicro/pyrenode3/blob/main/README.md).

## Evaluating the model in Kenning

Kenning can evaluate the runtime running on a device simulated in Renode. This allows us to:

* Analyze model behavior without the need for physical hardware
* Check model and runtime performance and quality on a simulated device in Continuous Integration pipelines
* Obtain detailed metrics regarding device usage (e.g. histogram of instructions)

### Creating the scenario

The following scenario is used for evaluating the model on Springbok AI accelerator in Renode:

```{literalinclude} ../scripts/jsonconfigs/renode-magic-wand-iree-bare-metal-inference.json
:language: json
```

The model used in the scenario is a classifier trained on Magic Wand dataset for accelerometer based gesture recognition:

* `dataset` entry provides a class for managing the Magic Wand dataset (downloading the dataset, parsing data from files, an evaluating the model on Springbok by sending inputs and comparing outputs to ground truth).
* `model_wrapper` entry provides the model to optimize, I/O specification and model-specific processing.

IREE compiler is enabled by adding it to the `optimizers`.
It optimizes and compiles the model to Virtual Machine Flat Buffer format (`.vmfb`), which is later executed on a minimal IREE virtual machine.
The additional flags provided to the compiler specify the RISC-V target architecture and V Extension features compatible with the Springbok accelerator.

Renode simulation is enabled by specifying the `simulated` in the `platform`'s parameters' and setting the following parameters:

* `name` - name of the simulated board (int this case `stm32f746g_disco`)
* `runtime_binary_path` - path to the runtime binary (in this case IREE runtime)
* `platform_resc_path` - path to the Renode script (`.resc` file) used for setting up the emulation
* `resc_dependencies` - additional dependencies for RESC files
* `post_start_commands` - Renode monitor commands executed after emulation starts
* `profiler_dump_path` - path for the profiler dump, which is then used for report generation

UART is used for Kenning communications by selecting `UARTProtocol` in `protocol` entry.

### Running the scenario

Evaluate the model in Renode using the created scenario, and generate a report with performance and quality metrics:

```bash
kenning optimize test report \
    --json-cfg https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antmicro/kenning/main/scripts/jsonconfigs/renode-magic-wand-iree-bare-metal-inference.json \
    --measurements ./results.json \
    --report-path ./reports/springbok-magic-wand.md \
    --report-name v-extensions-riscv \
    --model-names magic_wand_fp32 \
    --verbosity INFO \
    --to-html
```

Kenning executes the scenario in the following steps:

* Kenning loads the model with Keras and compiles it with IREE to `./build/magic-wand.vmfb`
* The machine with the Springbok AI accelerator is created in Renode
* Connection to the simulated device is established via UART
* Kenning sends the compiled model and I/O specification
* Input data is sent in a loop, the bare-metal IREE runtime performs inference and sends the results back

When the scenario is finished Kenning stores runtime metrics, profiling results and model evaluation in `results.json`.

The human readable report generated from `results.json` will be available under `reports/springbok-magic-wand/report.md`.
