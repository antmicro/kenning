# Introduction

{{projecturl}} provides an API for deploying deep learning applications on edge devices using various model training and compilation frameworks.

This documentation consists of the following chapters:

* [Kenning](project-readme) section provides a project description, installation steps and a quick start guide,
* [Deep Learning deployment stack](dl-deployment-stack) section describes a typical model deployment flow on edge devices,
* [Defining optimization pipelines in Kenning](json-scenarios) section describes a way to create advanced optimization scenarios with JSON config,
* [Using Kenning via command-line arguments](cmd-usage) section describes executable scripts available in {{projecturl}},
* [Kenning gallery](kenning-gallery) contains use cases with models optimization and integration with ROS2, Renode and Pipeline Manager,
* [Kenning environment variables](kenning-variables) section describes specific variables which can influence how the Kenning works,
* [Kenning measurements](kenning-measurements) section describes data gathered during the compilation and evaluation process,
* [Choosing optimal optimization pipeline](pipeline-optimizer) section describes a way to run multiple pipelines and search for the one that achieves the best result
* [Sample autogenerated report](sample-report) section provides a sample report generated using {{projecturl}},
* [Creating applications with Kenning](kenning-flow) section describes KenningFlow and its usage,
* [Developing Kenning blocks](kenning-development) section describes a way to develop new Kenning components,
* [Kenning resources](kenning-resources) section describes how Kenning deals with its resources (pretrained models, datasets etc.),
* [Kenning API](kenning-api) section provides an in-depth description of the {{projecturl}} API.
